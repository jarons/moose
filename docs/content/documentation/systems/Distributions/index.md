# Distributions System
The distribution system within MOOSE provides an API for defining and retrieving distribution  
function objects in C++, primarily for use with the [Stochastic Tools](stochastic_tools/index.md)
module. For additional details see the [Distributions](stochastic_tools/index.md#distributions)
section.
