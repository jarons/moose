# The tensile strength is 0.5 and Young=1 and Poisson=0.25.
# Using smoothing_tol=0.01, the return-map algorithm should
# return to, approximately, stress_I=stress_II=0.5.  This
# is a reduction of 0.65, so stress_III is approximately
# 0.68849 - 0.25 * 0.65 * 2 = 0.36.  The stress_I reduction of
# 0.67 gives an internal parameter of
# 0.67 / (E(1-v)/(1+v)/(1-2v)) = 0.558
# The final stress is
#
# {0.498, -0.003, 0.017},
# {-0.003, 0.495, 0.024},
# {0.017, 0.024,  0.367}
